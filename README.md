 #### RGB led and Potentiometers
+ **Technical Task**: Use a separate potentiometer in controlling each of the color of the RGB led (Red, Green and Blue). The control must be done
with digital electronics (aka you must read the value of the potentiometer with Arduino, and write a mapped value to each of the pins connected
to the led.
  
|**Components**:|1 RBG led| 3 potentiometers| resistors|and wires (per logic)|

  <summary> Homework 2 (27th October-3rd November 2021) </summary>
  
 #### Crosswalk simulator: traffic lights for people and cars
+ **Technical Task**:Building the traffic lights for a crosswalk. You will use 2 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for people (red and green)
and 3 LEDs to represent the traffic lights for cars (red, yellow and green). See the states it needs to go through. If anything is not clear, ask. Also, see the uploaded video (the intervals are different, but the states flow is the same). It’s a traffic lights system for people and cars - don’t overthink it.
  
|**Components**:|5 LEDs|1 button|1 buzzer|resistors|and wires (per logic)|

  <summary> Homework 3 (4th November-11th November 2021) </summary>
  
 #### EMF detector
+ **Technical Task**:Basically, we’re building the ghost detector (aka an EMF - electromagneticfield  -  detector).   It’s  super  easy  to  build,  and  you  will  have  to  look  on  the internet how to do it.  Basic requirements: should detect EMF (check body and near outlets.  DO NOT IN-SERT INTO OUTLET - AKA NU-L BAGATI IN PRIZA). It should printthe value on the 7-segment display (or light the led bar)andshould makea sound based on the intensity
  
|**Components**:|1 buzzer|7 segment display|resistors|and wires (per logic)|
